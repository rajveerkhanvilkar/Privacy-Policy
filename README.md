## � About Apka Rakshak

In the modern digital landscape, scammers often send malicious APK files via WhatsApp to gain unauthorized access to devices. Apka Rakshak acts as a **Security Interception Layer** that catches these files before they can harm your device.

### Core Features:
- 🛡️ **Intelligent Origin Detection**: Automatically detects if an APK originated from high-risk messaging folders.
- ⚠️ **Premium Warning System**: Shows a high-visibility danger alert for suspicious files with detailed risk information.
- ⏳ **3-Second Safety Guard**: Implements a mandatory 3-second wait timer to prevent accidental or rushed installations.
- 🔄 **Safe Forwarding**: For verified or user-approved files, the app seamlessly hands off to the official Android System Package Installer.
- ⚡ **Zero-Flicker Interception**: Uses a "Truly Transparent" theme for lightning-fast, non-intrusive security checks.
- 🔒 **Privacy-First Design**: Operates entirely offline—no data ever leaves your device.
